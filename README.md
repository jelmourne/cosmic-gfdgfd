Cosmic Queries is a cutting-edge application that is designed specifically to simplify the planning and management of a music festival. It serves as a database management system that features a user-friendly content management system (CMS) that helps organizers keep track and manage important aspects of their festival's components. Users will have the ability to easily handle important tasks such as scheduling, ticketing, production and various other aspects of the management process.

The application would be able to connect to the festival's website where customers are able to find information about the festival as well as purchase tickets. When tickets are bought, this will be reflected and recorded in the application.
